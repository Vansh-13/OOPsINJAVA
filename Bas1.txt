//wrapper classes
Interger num=45;  wrapper claees are final not changes there values bhale hi y refernce ho
//alwayas intialize the final keyword while declaring it

//static //this all static belong to the class not a class object
Understanding static: //not realted any object
When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created,
and without reference to any object. You can declare both methods and variables to be static.
--> any static method usker ander non-static not accessabel; static only access static -->but vice-versa is true
//but it can access not-static in staitc jab hm instancce bna lenge ab access ho sakta h
static void fun(){
Main ob=new Main();
ob.m(); //m is non-static access only instance creted
}
--> static are compile time beacuse object crete runtime but sttic not relted object
